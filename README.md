# ðŸŒ¿LeafDisease-Detector-Using-Deeplearning

## Project Overview
Leaf diseases pose a significant threat to crop yields and food security. This project utilizes deep learning, specifically transfer learning with ResNet152V2, to classify images of leaves as healthy or diseased, and further identify the specific disease category. The goal is to enable rapid, scalable, and accurate detection to support agricultural practices.

## Features
**Transfer Learning**: Uses ResNet152V2, a proven deep convolutional neural network, pre-trained on ImageNet for high accuracy.

**Multi-Class Classification**: Detects multiple diseases across apple, tomato, and potato plants.

**Easy-to-Use**: Jupyter Notebook implementation for reproducibility and quick experimentation.

**Custom Dataset Handling**: Automatically loads and preprocesses labeled leaf disease images.

**Model Evaluation**: Includes performance metrics, confusion matrices, and visualizations.

## Dataset
A labeled dataset containing images of various leaf diseases, primarily affecting apple, tomato, and potato plants.
Each image is labeled according to plant type and disease category.
