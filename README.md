# ðŸŒ¿LeafDisease-Detector-Using-Deeplearning

## Project Overview
Leaf diseases pose a significant threat to crop yields and food security. This project utilizes deep learning, specifically transfer learning with ResNet152V2, to classify images of leaves as healthy or diseased, and further identify the specific disease category. The goal is to enable rapid, scalable, and accurate detection to support agricultural practices.

Dataset:A labeled dataset containing images of various leaf diseases, primarily affecting apple, tomato, and potato plants, with each image categorized by the type of disease present.
